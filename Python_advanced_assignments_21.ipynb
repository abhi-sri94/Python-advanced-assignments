        "A probability distribution is a mathematical function or description that specifies the likelihood or probability of different outcomes or events occurring within a given set or range. It provides a way to model and quantify uncertainty or randomness in various scenarios, such as in statistics, probability theory, and data analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "While the values in a probability distribution may be considered random, the distribution itself provides information about the likelihood of those values occurring. It does not predict specific outcomes but rather describes the pattern or behavior of a random phenomenon. Probability distributions are used to analyze and understand the range of possible outcomes, their probabilities, and their relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "Probability distributions come in various types, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) **Discrete Probability Distribution** : Deals with discrete or countable outcomes, where each possible value has a specific probability associated with it. Examples include the binomial distribution and the Poisson distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) **Continuous Probability Distribution** : Deals with continuous outcomes, often described by a probability density function. Examples include the normal distribution (Gaussian distribution) and the exponential distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) **Multivariate Probability Distribution** : Describes the joint probability of multiple random variables occurring simultaneously. Examples include the multivariate normal distribution and the joint distribution of two or more variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) **Empirical Probability Distribution** : Derived from observed data, it estimates the probabilities of different outcomes based on the frequency of their occurrences in a sample.\n",
        "\n",
        "Probability distributions allow us to make statistical inferences, estimate probabilities, and analyze random phenomena even though we cannot predict individual outcomes with certainty. By understanding the distribution of possible outcomes and their associated probabilities, we can make informed decisions, perform statistical analyses, and gain insights into the underlying randomness or uncertainty of a given situation."

        "Yes, there is a distinction between true random numbers and pseudo-random numbers:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) **True Random Numbers** : True random numbers are generated from genuinely unpredictable physical processes, such as electronic noise, radioactive decay, or atmospheric noise. These processes provide a source of randomness that is theoretically impossible to predict. True random number generators (TRNGs) exploit these unpredictable phenomena to generate random numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) **Pseudo-Random Numbers** : Pseudo-random numbers are generated using deterministic algorithms. While the numbers generated by these algorithms appear to be random, they are actually determined by an initial value called a seed. Once the seed is set, the algorithm follows a predictable sequence of steps to generate numbers that exhibit statistical properties similar to randomness. Pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) can produce long sequences of numbers that mimic randomness but are entirely determined by the initial seed.\n",
        "\n",
        "The reason pseudo-random numbers are considered \"good enough\" in many applications is that they exhibit properties of randomness that are sufficient for most practical purposes. These properties include uniformity (each number in the range is equally likely), independence (previous numbers do not predict future numbers), and statistical randomness (passing various statistical tests for randomness).\n",

        "Answer 3 -\n",

        "The behavior of a \"normal\" probability distribution, also known as a Gaussian distribution or bell curve, is primarily influenced by two main factors:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) **Mean (μ)** : The mean, often denoted by `μ` (mu), represents the central value or average of the distribution. It determines the center of the distribution and acts as a measure of location. The mean determines where the peak of the bell curve is located. A higher mean shifts the distribution to the right, while a lower mean shifts it to the left.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) **Standard Deviation (σ)** : The standard deviation, denoted by `σ` (sigma), measures the spread or dispersion of the distribution. It quantifies the extent to which data points deviate from the mean. A smaller standard deviation results in a narrower, taller curve, while a larger standard deviation leads to a wider, flatter curve. The standard deviation also affects the shape of the tails of the distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Together, the mean and standard deviation play a crucial role in defining the shape, center, and spread of the normal distribution. The normal distribution is symmetric around its mean, and its shape is determined by the mean and standard deviation."

        "2) **Standard Deviation (`σ`)** : The standard deviation of heights measures how much individual heights deviate from the mean.
