        "Answer 1 -\n",
        "\n",
        "An abstract superclass is a class that is designed to serve as a blueprint for other classes but is not meant to be instantiated directly. Instead, its main purpose is to define a common interface, attributes, and methods that its subclasses are expected to implement or override. Abstract superclasses provide a way to enforce a certain structure and behavior across multiple related classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "The concept of an abstract superclass is closely tied to the concept of abstraction in object-oriented programming. Abstraction involves defining the essential characteristics of an object while hiding the unnecessary details. Abstract superclasses help create a higher level of abstraction by defining common features and behaviors that multiple subclasses should adhere to.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key points about abstract superclasses include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) **Cannot be Instantiated** : An abstract superclass is defined using the abc module's ABC class as a base class. It includes one or more abstract methodsâ€”methods without an implementation. Because abstract methods lack a concrete implementation, the abstract superclass cannot be instantiated directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) **Defines a Contract** : The abstract superclass defines a contract that its subclasses must follow. This contract includes the names of methods that must be implemented by the subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) **Subclass Implementation** : Subclasses of an abstract superclass must provide concrete implementations for all the abstract methods defined by the superclass. This enforces a consistent behavior across all subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) **Polymorphism** : The use of an abstract superclass allows different subclasses to be treated uniformly, promoting polymorphism. Code that interacts with objects of the abstract superclass type can be reused with any subclass.\n",
