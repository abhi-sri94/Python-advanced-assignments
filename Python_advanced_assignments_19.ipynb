        "\n",
        "1) **Attributes (Data Members)** : Classes define attributes, also known as data members, which represent the properties or characteristics of objects. These attributes store the data that an object holds. Each instance of the class can have its own values for these attributes. For example, in a `Person` class, attributes might include `name` , `age` , and `gender` .\n",

        "2) **Methods (Member Functions)** : Classes include methods, which are functions that define the behavior or actions that objects of the class can perform. Methods can operate on the attributes of the class and can interact with other objects. For instance, a Person class might have methods like `say_hello()` or `calculate_age()` .\n",

        "5) **Inheritance and Polymorphism** : Classes can be organized in a hierarchy using inheritance, where a subclass inherits attributes and methods from a parent (base) class. This promotes code reuse and allows for more specialized classes to be created.\n",
