        "\n",
        "Some of the notable features added in Python 3.8 include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) **Assignment Expressions (:= Operator)** : Python 3.8 introduced the \"`walrus operator`\" (`:=`), which allows you to assign values to variables as part of an expression. This is particularly useful in list comprehensions, lambda functions, and other contexts where you want to combine assignment and computation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) **Positional-Only Parameters** : Python 3.8 introduced support for defining `positional-only` parameters in function signatures using the `/` syntax. This provides more control over how function arguments can be passed.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) **f-string Improvements**: F-strings (`formatted string literals`) gained new features, including the ability to use the `=` character to display both the variable name and its value in debug output.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) **future Annotations** : New **`__future__`** annotations were introduced to make it easier to enable and test upcoming language features before they become the default behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "5) **TypedDict** : The typing module introduced the `TypedDict` class, which allows you to define dictionaries with a specific set of keys and value types, providing better type checking and documentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "6) **Syntax Warnings** : Python 3.8 introduced new syntax warnings for cases where the code uses features that are being deprecated or changed in future Python versions.\n",
        "\n",
        "7) **New Syntax Features** : Python 3.8 added the `continue` statement in a `finally` block, allowing you to skip the remaining code in the finally block and continue with the loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "8) **Math Functions Improvements** : The math module was extended with new functions, including **math.prod()** for computing the product of iterable elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "9) **Performance Optimizations** : Python 3.8 included various performance improvements, such as optimized built-in functions and faster dictionary operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "10) **future Annotations** : Python 3.8 introduced the ability to use **`__future__`** annotations to enable or disable specific language features, allowing developers to use upcoming syntax and behavior in an opt-in manner."

        "Monkey patching in Python refers to the practice of dynamically modifying or extending classes, modules, or functions at runtime. It involves altering the behavior of existing code, often to add new features, fix bugs, or modify the behavior of third-party libraries without directly modifying their source code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Monkey patching can be a powerful technique, but it should be used with caution because it can lead to unexpected behavior, compatibility issues, and difficulties in debugging. It's generally considered good practice to avoid monkey patching whenever possible and to use more structured and maintainable approaches, such as subclassing, composition, or creating wrappers.\n",
