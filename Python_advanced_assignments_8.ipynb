        "In Python, when exceptions are raised, they are matched to exception handlers using the inheritance hierarchy of the exception classes. This means that if a specific exception class is not caught by a handler, Python will check for more general exception classes in the hierarchy.\n",
        "\n",
        "The process of matching class-based exceptions to handlers works as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) When an exception is raised, Python searches for a suitable exception handler in the current scope and then in the surrounding scopes (outer blocks).\n",
        "\n",

        "In older versions of Python (Python 2.x), string-based exceptions were used to raise and catch exceptions by passing error messages as strings. However, in Python 3.x, string-based exceptions have been deprecated and replaced by exception classes, which offer several advantages over the older approach. Here are some reasons why string-based exceptions are no longer used in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) **Improved Organization and Extensibility** :\n",
        "Exception classes provide a more organized and extensible way to handle errors. By defining custom exception classes that inherit from the built-in Exception class or its subclasses, you can categorize and differentiate errors based on their types, making your code more structured and maintainable.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) **Precise Error Handling** :\n",
        "Exception classes allow you to catch specific types of exceptions using except blocks. This enables you to provide tailored error handling based on the type of error, leading to more precise error resolution and better debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) **Clearer Code and Documentation** :\n",
        "Exception classes come with meaningful names that provide a clear indication of the error's nature. This makes your code more readable and helps others understand the purpose of exceptions without having to rely solely on error messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) **Consistency and Standardization** :\n",
        "Exception classes adhere to a standardized hierarchy, making it easier to recognize common exception types and their relationships. This consistency helps developers quickly understand the error-handling logic in various parts of the codebase.\n",
        "\n",
        "5) **Enhanced Tracebacks and Debugging** :\n",
        "Exception classes offer enhanced traceback information that includes details about the exception's type, location, and context. This information is invaluable for debugging and understanding the cause of errors.\n",
