In other words, a class can have multiple superclasses from which it inherits properties and behaviors. This feature enables the creation of complex class hierarchies and the sharing of functionality from multiple sources.\n",

        "What is the concept of delegation?\n",
        "\n",
        "............\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer 2 -\n",
        "\n",
        "Delegation, in the context of object-oriented programming, refers to a design pattern where an object (the delegator) forwards or delegates certain tasks or responsibilities to another object (the delegate). Instead of implementing all the functionality directly, the delegator relies on the delegate to perform specific tasks on its behalf.\n",
        "\n",
        "Delegation is a powerful concept that promotes code reuse, modularity, and separation of concerns. It allows you to create more flexible and maintainable code by breaking down complex systems into smaller, manageable components. Delegation is often used in situations where inheritance or composition might not be the best fit or where you want to encapsulate behavior in a separate object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key points about delegation include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) **Responsibility Sharing** : With delegation, an object delegates specific responsibilities or tasks to another object that specializes in performing those tasks. This helps distribute functionality among different objects, making the codebase more modular.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) **Composition Over Inheritance** : Delegation is often used as an alternative to inheritance, promoting composition. Instead of inheriting behavior, an object includes instances of other objects (delegates) that provide specialized functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) **Flexibility** : Delegation allows you to change or extend the behavior of an object by swapping out or modifying its delegates. This can be especially useful when you want to change the behavior of a component without altering the entire class hierarchy.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) **Code Reusability** : By encapsulating specific behaviors in delegate objects, you can reuse those behaviors across multiple classes. This reduces code duplication and promotes a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "5) **Separation of Concerns** : Delegation helps separate different concerns and responsibilities. Each delegate can focus on a specific task, improving code organization and readability.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example** : A common example of delegation is found in the Python standard library's collections.Counter class. The Counter class uses a dictionary as a delegate to store the counts of elements in a collection. The Counter class delegates the management of the dictionary to perform operations like element counting, addition, and subtraction.\n",

        "Composition is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that refers to the practice of creating complex objects by combining or composing simpler objects. In other words, composition involves building larger and more complex classes by including instances of other classes as components or parts.\n",
