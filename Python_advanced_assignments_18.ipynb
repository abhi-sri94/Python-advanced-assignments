        "Text files and binary files are two types of computer files that store data. Text files contain human-readable characters encoded using character encodings like ASCII or UTF-8. They primarily store textual information such as plain text documents, source code, configuration files, and more. In contrast, binary files store data in a format that isn't directly human-readable and may include a wide range of data types, including images, audio, video, executables, and serialized objects. While text files can be edited with standard text editors, binary files often require specialized software and are usually processed by applications designed for specific data types. The distinction between text and binary files influences how data is stored, interpreted, and manipulated, making text files more accessible for human understanding and editing, while binary files are more versatile for handling various types of data efficiently."

        "1) **Configuration Files** : Storing configuration settings and parameters in text files allows easy human-readable editing and management by both developers and users.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) **Source Code** : Text files are the standard format for storing source code in programming languages, facilitating version control, collaboration, and code review.\n",

        "\n",
        "..............\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer 3 -\n",
        "\n",
        "Using binary operations to read and write a Python integer directly to disk can introduce several challenges and potential issues:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) **Endianness** : Different computer architectures use different byte orders (`endianness`) to store multi-byte data types like integers. If you're not careful, reading or writing integers in the wrong endianness can lead to data corruption or incorrect values when moving between systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) **Platform Compatibility** : When writing binary data, you need to consider the compatibility of the format across different platforms (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux). Differences in endianness, data size, and padding can affect how integers are stored and read.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) **Portability** : Binary data files might not be portable across different versions of Python or even different platforms. Changes in the Python interpreter's internal representation of integers could affect the binary representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) **Error Handling** : Binary reading and writing require careful error handling to account for situations like file corruption, missing files, unexpected data formats, and more. In contrast, higher-level file I/O functions in Python provide built-in error handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "5) **Data Type Interpretation** : When reading binary data, you need to ensure that you interpret the bytes correctly to reconstruct the integer. Incorrect interpretation can lead to reading incorrect values or raising exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "6) **Complexity** : Binary operations involve low-level byte manipulation and require careful attention to detail. This complexity can make the code harder to understand, maintain, and debug compared to using higher-level I/O functions provided by Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "7) **Data Corruption** : If there are any mistakes or bugs in your binary read/write code, it could lead to data corruption or loss, which may not be immediately evident.\n",
        "\n",
        "To mitigate these issues, it's often recommended to use higher-level I/O functions provided by Python, such as pickle, struct, or libraries like numpy for more complex data types. These libraries abstract away many of the low-level details and provide better cross-platform compatibility and error handling. If you do decide to work with binary data directly, it's crucial to thoroughly test your code and ensure it works consistently across different platforms and versions of Python."

        "Using the `with` keyword (context manager) in Python when working with files offers the benefit of automatic resource management, ensuring that files are properly opened and closed without the need for explicit open and close statements. This has several advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) **Automatic Cleanup** : When a file is opened within a `with` block, it is automatically closed at the end of the block, even if an exception is raised. This helps prevent resource leaks and ensures that files are properly closed, reducing the risk of errors in your code.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) **Readability and Maintainability** : The `with` statement makes the code more concise and easier to read by encapsulating the file operations within a clearly defined scope. It enhances code organization and reduces the need to remember to close files explicitly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) **Exception Safety** : Using `with` ensures that file resources are released properly, even in the presence of exceptions. If an exception occurs within the with block, the file is guaranteed to be closed before the exception propagates, preventing data corruption or loss.\n",

        "When using the `shelve` package for persistent storage of Python objects, one important restriction to be aware of is that the keys used in a shelve database must be strings. Unlike regular dictionaries or other data structures, shelve enforces this restriction because it uses the keys for indexing and managing the stored data efficiently.\n",
