        "Answer 1 -\n",
        "\n",
        "Exception processing, also known as error handling or exception handling, is a crucial aspect of programming that helps manage unexpected or exceptional situations in a controlled manner. Here are three applications for exception processing:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) **Input Validation and Error Reporting** :\n",
        "When your program interacts with external data sources, such as user input, files, databases, or network requests, there is a possibility of encountering incorrect or unexpected data. Exception processing allows you to validate and sanitize input data, ensuring that your program can handle various scenarios without crashing or producing incorrect results. For example, you can catch exceptions raised due to invalid input and provide meaningful error messages to users.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) **Resource Management and Cleanup** :\n",
        "Exception processing is used to manage resources like files, database connections, network sockets, or memory allocations. If an exception occurs during the use of these resources, it's essential to release them properly to prevent memory leaks or resource exhaustion. Using constructs like the `try...finally` block, you can ensure that cleanup operations are performed even if an exception occurs, guaranteeing the correct release of resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) **Debugging and Logging** :\n",
        "Exception processing provides a mechanism to catch and handle unexpected errors, helping you identify and fix issues during development and production. By capturing exceptions and logging relevant information, you can gain insights into the cause of failures, which aids in debugging and improving the reliability of your software. Properly implemented exception handling can make it easier to diagnose problems and provide valuable information for troubleshooting.\n",

        "Answer 2 -\n",
        "\n",
        "If you don't implement exception handling or take any additional steps to treat an exception, the default behavior is for the program to terminate and an error message to be displayed. This behavior can be disruptive to both the user and the overall functioning of the program. Without proper exception handling, your program might:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) **Crash** : When an unhandled exception occurs, the program crashes, and the control flow is abruptly terminated. This can lead to unexpected program termination and a poor user experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) **Error Messages** : Depending on the programming language and environment, an error message may be displayed to the user. This message might be cryptic and not helpful for diagnosing the issue.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) **Resource Leaks** : If the exception occurs during the use of resources like files, network connections, or memory, these resources might not be properly released or closed. This can lead to memory leaks or other resource-related problems.\n",
